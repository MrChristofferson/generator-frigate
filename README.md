> Yeoman generator for front-end developers

## Features

* Application structure and setup that works for single page apps and web sites.
* Full featured front-end workflow setup with:
  * Webpack w/ React hot reloading support
  * Sass and CSS auto-prefixing
  * CSS and JavaScript minification
  * React unit testing
  * BrowserSync
* Built-in static server (optional)


## Usage

You'll need `yo` - the scaffolding tool from `Yeoman` - installed:
```
npm install -g yo
```

Install `generator-frigate`:
```
npm install -g generator-frigate
```

Make a new directory, and `cd` into it:
```
mkdir my-new-project && cd $_
```

Run:
```
yo frigate
```

Run `npm start` for asset watching/compiling with BrowserSync support and `make all` for a production-ready build

## Documentation

Docs are generated using Sphinx.

```
pip install Sphinx
cd <project_root>/docs && make html
```

You can then open *file:///<project_root>/docs/_build/html/index.html* in a browser.


Alternative: run the following then browse to *http://localhost:8000*.
```
cd docs/_build_html && python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 &
```

## Developing

If you'd like to add to or change Frigate's functionality, the following approach is recommended. First, install the Frigate source and then install it as a linked package::

```
git clone https://github.com/lincolnloop/generator-frigate.git
cd generator-frigate
npm link
```

Next, you'll want a test project for running Gulp tasks and testing your changes::

```
cd .. && mkdir test-frigate && cd test-frigate
yo frigate
```

After you make changes in the generator-frigate source, re-run ``yo frigate`` in the test project and the project's state will be updated to match the current state of the Frigate code
